On POSIX platforms it can be built using the standards autotools process:

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

the library itself will be built, along with the testsuite and a command-line
test encoder.

To run the test suite:

  make check

TEST ENCODER
------------

To run the commandline encoder:

  ./testprogs/vc2encode [<input filename>]

Input files should be raw video in planar YUV format, with 10-bit samples in the most significant 
10-bits of each 16-bit word OR in V210 foramt.

command line options exist, a help message can be extracted via:

  ./testprogs/vc2decode --help

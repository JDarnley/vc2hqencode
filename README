This is the VC-2 HQ Profile encoder library.

It is quite performant, and scales well across multiple threads.

For licensing information check the COPYING file.

POSIX Platforms
---------------

On POSIX platforms it can be built using the standards autotools process:

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

the library itself will be built, along with the testsuite and a command-line
test encoder.

To run the test suite:

  make check

To run the commandline encoder:

  ./testprogs/vc2encode [<input filename>]

command line options exist, a help message can be extracted via:

  ./testprogs/vc2decode --help



WINDOWS
-------

Windows support is coming some time.
